# RoboND - Project2: Go Chase It
Project 2 of Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Summary of Tasks  
In this project two ROS packages have been created inside `catkin_ws/src`: the `drive_bot` and the `ball_chaser` which will be used in Gazebo for all the upcoming projects in the [Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/robotics-software-engineer--nd209). Here are the steps to design the robot, house it inside your world, and program it to chase white-colored ball:  
1. `drive_bot`:  
* Create a `my_robot` ROS package to hold your robot, the white ball, and the world.
* Design a differential drive robot with the Unified Robot Description Format. Add two sensors to your robot: a lidar and a camera. Add Gazebo plugins for your robot’s differential drive, lidar, and camera. The robot you design should be significantly different from the one presented in the project lesson. Implement significant changes such as adjusting the color, wheel radius, and chassis dimensions. Or completely redesign the robot model! After all you want to impress your future employers :-D
* House your robot inside the world you built: **worldchase.world** in this project.
* Add a white-colored ball to your Gazebo world and save a new copy of this world.
* The `world.launch` file should launch your world with the white-colored ball and your robot.
2. `ball_chaser`:
* Create a `ball_chaser` ROS package to hold your C++ nodes.
* Write a `drive_bot` C++ node that will provide a `ball_chaser/command_robot` service to drive the robot by controlling its linear x and angular z velocities. The service should publish to the wheel joints and return back the requested velocities.
* Write a `process_image` C++ node that reads your robot’s camera image, analyzes it to determine the presence and position of a white ball. If a white ball exists in the image, your node should request a service via a client to drive the robot towards it.
* The `ball_chaser.launch` should run both the `drive_bot` and the `process_image` nodes.  

## Setup Instructions
1. Open Ubuntu Bash and clone the project repository  
2. On the command line execute  
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
4. Build and run your code.

## Run the project  
* Clone this repository
* Then execute
```
cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
```
* Launch my_robot in Gazebo to load both the world and plugins  
```
roslaunch my_robot world.launch
```   
* Launch ball_chaser and process_image nodes  
```
cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch ball_chaser ball_chaser.launch
```  
* Visualize  
```
cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view  
```  
Now place the white ball at different positions in front of the robot and see if the robot is capable of chasing the ball!
